ATR Maker Deluxe converts unprotected Atari 8-bit floppy disks to .ATR files. It should 
be used with a DOS that supports large files (more than 90K for a single density
ATR image, etc.), and should be used with large capacity storage devices, for
example, ones that support 16MB ATR images (for output) such as the SDrive-Max, 
systems running atariserver, etc.

The program is simple to use. The user specifies the source drive containing the
floppy, the destination drive (which should contain an appropriate DOS file system).

Error (bad) sectors can be handled by retrying or skipping - there are 4 different
error handling options in total.

The destination filename can be specified by the user, an existing file will not be 
over-written unless the user wishes to do so.

The status line at the top of the display shows: 

   source drive
   destination drive and filename
   sector currently being read
   sector size in bytes
   number of sides supported by the drive
   
The source code (ATASM 6502 assembler) is included on the disks. The development 
environment was WUDSN IDE running on Linux. The intention is to extend the functionality
provided by the software, as such the source code includes definitions for features
that have not yet been implemented. Updated source code will be made available on 
https:github.com/e474/atrmaker/ - once the software competions has finished.   

The software is licensed under GPL v3, see LICENSE.TXT on the disks for more information.
